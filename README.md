## Overview

My custom Task notification solution is designed to enhance the Salesforce experience by providing real-time notifications when new tasks are created. This solution ensures that team members stay informed and can take immediate action when a new task is assigned to them or associated with specific records.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Whenever a new task is created in Salesforce, My solution triggers a custom notification to notify the relevant team members. This ensures that important tasks don't go unnoticed and can be addressed promptly.

- **Dynamic Content**: The notification content is dynamically generated based on the task's details and related records. It provides clear and concise information about the task's purpose and any associated records, making it easy for users to understand the context.

- **Customizable Notification Types**: My solution allows for the creation of various notification types, enabling you to tailor notifications to different scenarios. For example, you can define notification types for sales-related tasks, customer support tasks, or any other specific use case.

- **Flexible Targeting**: Notifications can be sent to specific users or groups within yMy Salesforce organization. This ensures that the right people receive the right information at the right time.

- **Efficiency**: By streamlining the notification process, My solution helps yMy team become more efficient and responsive. Tasks no longer get lost in the shuffle, and everyone can stay on top of their responsibilities.

## How It Works

My custom Task notification solution is implemented as a trigger in Salesforce. It activates after a new task is inserted. The trigger then calls a dedicated Apex class that constructs the notification content based on the task's details, such as the task's subject, associated records, and ownership.

The notification's title, content, sender, and type are all customized to ensure that it provides valuable and actionable information. Once the notification is prepared, it is sent to the appropriate user or group using Salesforce's custom notification system.
